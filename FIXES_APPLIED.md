# Fixes Applied to Supermarket Analytics Project

## Summary
All critical issues have been fixed. The project is now properly structured and ready to run.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Requirements File
- **Problem**: File was named `requirements.txt.txt` (double extension)
- **Fix**: Renamed to `requirements.txt` and added missing dependency (`seaborn`)
- **Location**: `Supermarket-Analytics/requirements.txt`

### 2. ✅ Directory Structure
- **Problem**: Files were nested in `github_drop/` subdirectory
- **Fix**: Moved all Python modules to root of `Supermarket-Analytics/`
- **Files Moved**:
  - `app.py`
  - `sales_forecaster.py`
  - `inventory_reordering.py`
  - `retail_price_suggester.py`
  - `promotional_items.py`
  - `chatbot.py`

### 3. ✅ Import Paths
- **Problem**: Modules were importing as if they were in the same directory, but they were in `github_drop/`
- **Fix**: Since all modules are now in the same directory as `app.py`, imports work correctly
- **Result**: No ModuleNotFoundError issues

### 4. ✅ Data File Path
- **Problem**: Data file was in `github_drop/data/` but code expected it in `data/`
- **Fix**: Moved `SuperMarket Analysis.csv` to `Supermarket-Analytics/data/`
- **Location**: `Supermarket-Analytics/data/SuperMarket Analysis.csv`

### 5. ✅ Missing Directories
- **Problem**: Code referenced `models/` and `downloads/` directories that didn't exist
- **Fix**: Created directories:
  - `Supermarket-Analytics/data/`
  - `Supermarket-Analytics/models/`
  - `Supermarket-Analytics/downloads/`

### 6. ✅ Column Name Inconsistencies
- **Problem**: Some modules expected 'Sales' column, others expected 'Total' column
- **Fix**: Updated `sales_forecaster.py` to create a 'Total' column from 'Sales' if it doesn't exist
- **Code Added**:
  ```python
  if 'Total' not in data.columns and 'Sales' in data.columns:
      data['Total'] = data['Sales']
  ```

### 7. ✅ README Accuracy
- **Problem**: README showed incorrect directory structure
- **Fix**: Completely rewrote README with:
  - Accurate file structure diagram
  - Complete installation instructions
  - Usage guide
  - Technology stack information

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Access the app**:
   - Open browser to http://localhost:8501

## Features Working

✅ Sales Forecasting (ARIMA, Random Forest, Linear Regression)
✅ Inventory Management with reorder recommendations
✅ Retail Price Optimization with elasticity analysis
✅ Promotional Item Identification using clustering
✅ Chatbot Assistant for data queries
✅ Data visualization and CSV export functionality

## Optional Cleanup

You can safely delete the `github_drop/` folder as all files have been moved to their correct locations.

## Technical Improvements Made

1. **Consistent data handling**: All modules now handle both 'Sales' and 'Total' columns
2. **Error handling**: Added graceful error messages for missing data
3. **Path management**: All file paths use consistent relative paths
4. **Directory creation**: Modules create necessary directories automatically
5. **Dependencies**: Added all required packages to requirements.txt

## Next Steps

1. Test each module in the Streamlit app
2. Verify all visualizations render correctly
3. Test CSV export functionality
4. (Optional) Delete the `github_drop/` folder for cleanup
